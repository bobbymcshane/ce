todo:
- add config option for log destination (we want to init the log before the user config, so can we even do this?)
- dired mode
- message box
- undo in macros
- vim increment and decrement number on line
- vim 'delete' in insert mode
- visual block paste doesn't work as exected
- when turning macros into strings, support ctrl sequences /^j maybe

bug:
- shifting right/left on visual selection can lead to cursor getting set to -1, -1, not sure the exact case yet
- Sometimes chain undo will undo 2 actions, not sure how to reproduce yet
- terminal resize is weird with the scroll, where it doesn't seem to know where the bottom is correctly sometimes
- ctrl+j in completion creates extra lines that ruin drawing
