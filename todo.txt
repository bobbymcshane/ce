todo:
- add config option for log destination (we want to init the log before the user config, so can we even do this?)
- dired mode
- message box
- undo in macros actually removing some actions
- vim ctrl+w HJKL to move windows around
- regex replace for captures
- vim's 'gf'
- customization:
  - completion
  - status bar
  - key handler ?
- resurrect a terminal that has died
- put log and backup files, and session info in ~/.ce
- rename 'buffer_type' to 'syntax', 'buffer_mode', 'c-mode', idk
- vim :sort
- visual line should have config option to do what it does now, include the newline, or do the entire line

bug:
- shifting right/left on visual selection can lead to cursor getting set to -1, -1, not sure the exact case yet
- sometimes chain undo will undo 2 actions, not sure how to reproduce yet
- what is home key doing? It seems like it's sending '5~'
- TERM=xterm-256color needs to be set to view ce correctly
- sometimes the arrow keys are broken in the terminal on rhel6, not sure how to reproduce, but sometimes they work also?
- can't pick 'q' as a register when recording a macro
