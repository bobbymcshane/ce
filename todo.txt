todo:
- add config option for log destination (we want to init the log before the user config, so can we even do this?)
- dired mode
- message box
- undo in macros
- vim increment and decrement number on line
- vim ctrl+w HJKL to move windows around
- regex replace for captures
- vim ';', ','
- vim :find using bobby's old ce code

bug:
- shifting right/left on visual selection can lead to cursor getting set to -1, -1, not sure the exact case yet
- sometimes chain undo will undo 2 actions, not sure how to reproduce yet
- python multiline string comments are broken sometimes
- can't kill tabs
