todo:
- multiple terminals
- add config option for log destination (we want to init the log before the user config, so can we even do this?)
- dired mode

bug:
- slow to start, wtf
- divide by zero in ce_layout_distribute_rect()
- occasional blinking garbage when drawing
- dotting (repeat action) a lot then doing undo will undo all the dots!
- repeat action includes input mode changes !
- core dump when escaping after selecting parent
