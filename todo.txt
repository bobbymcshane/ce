todo:
- multiple terminals
- add config option for log destination (Not sure if we want to do this, because we want to init the log before the user config)
- dired mode
- highlight current line
- run command in terminal

bug:
- slow to start, wtf
- divide by zero in ce_layout_distribute_rect()
- lots of blinking and occasional garbage, especially over ssh (made some changes, unsure if fixed, definitely needs to be tested over ssh)
- ci" when cursor is on the ending quote doesn't work
- dFa shouldn't delete the character where the cursor is
