todo:
- have drawing a view take in a highlight range, rather than taking vim in
- have drawing take in a pattern string for searching to also highlight
- jump list
- terminal scrollback
- goto next/prev terminal output file destination
- multiple terminals
- delete buffer

bug:
- crash trying to delete last lines in file that are blank
- got stuck in visual block mode
- Vjd then dot doesn't delete entirely 2 lines below
- multiline commends don't seem to syntax highlight properly
