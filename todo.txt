todo:
- have drawing a view take in a highlight range, rather than taking vim in
- have drawing take in a pattern string for searching to also highlight
- jump list
- terminal scrollback
- goto next/prev terminal output file destination
- multiple terminals
- add config option for log destination
- when viewing terminal, use horizontal and vertical scroll off of 1
- dired mode

bug:
- crash trying to delete last lines in file that are blank
- occasional crash where vim verb gets motion of -1, -1
- indenting can leave you on the next line if your cursor starts at eol
