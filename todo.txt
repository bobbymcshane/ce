todo:
- add config option for log destination (we want to init the log before the user config, so can we even do this?)
- dired mode
- message box
- undo in macros
- vim ctrl+w HJKL to move windows around
- regex replace for captures
- 'gf'
- commands shouldn't need to be fully typed
- TERM=xterm-256color needs to be set to view correctly
- 'ZZ' is save and quit
- customization:
  - completion
  - status bar
  - key handler ?

bug:
- shifting right/left on visual selection can lead to cursor getting set to -1, -1, not sure the exact case yet
- sometimes chain undo will undo 2 actions, not sure how to reproduce yet
- python multiline string comments are broken sometimes
- 'o' escape goes back to far
- page up and page down keybind
- what is home key doing?
