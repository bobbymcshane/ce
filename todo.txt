todo:
- multiple terminals
- add config option for log destination (Not sure if we want to do this, because we want to init the log before the user config)
- dired mode
- line numbers
- highlight current line

bug:
- slow to start, wtf
- divide by zero in ce_layout_distribute_rect()
- lots of blinking and occasional garbage, especially over ssh (made some changes, unsure if fixed, definitely needs to be tested over ssh)

notes:
A "jump" is one of the following commands: "'", "`", "G", "/", "?", "n",
"N", "%", "(", ")", "[[", "]]", "{", "}", ":s", ":tag", "L", "M", "H" and
the commands that start editing a new file.
