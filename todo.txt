todo:
- have drawing a view take in a highlight range, rather than taking vim in
- have drawing take in a pattern string for searching to also highlight
- jump list
- terminal scrollback
- goto next/prev terminal output file destination
- multiple terminals
- add config option for log destination

bug:
- crash trying to delete last lines in file that are blank
- got stuck in visual block mode once, but not recently
- occasional crash where vim verb gets motion of -1, -1
- crash when visual highlighting all the lines in test.txt and deleting them
