todo:
- have drawing a view take in a highlight range, rather than taking vim in
- have drawing take in a pattern string for searching to also highlight
- jump list
- goto next/prev terminal output file destination
- multiple terminals
- add config option for log destination (Not sure if we want to do this, because we want to init the log before the user config)
- when viewing terminal, use horizontal and vertical scroll off of 1
- resize terminal when layout changes are made and terminal is in view
- dired mode

bug:
- occasional crash where vim verb gets motion of -1, -1
- slow to start, wtf
- handle ctrl + c, we want to be able to send it to the terminal
