todo:
- have drawing a view take in a highlight range, rather than taking vim in
- have drawing take in a pattern string for searching to also highlight
- jump list
- multiple terminals
- add config option for log destination (Not sure if we want to do this, because we want to init the log before the user config)
- dired mode
- python, bash, maybe java syntax highlighting

bug:
- occasional crash where vim verb gets motion of -1, -1
- slow to start, wtf
- handle ctrl + c, we want to be able to send it to the terminal
- indentation sux in a lot of places right now
- visual delete on the same line deletes and extra character when doing '.'
- divide by zero in ce_layout_distribute_rect()
