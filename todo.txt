todo:
- multiple terminals
- add config option for log destination (we want to init the log before the user config, so can we even do this?)
- dired mode
- message box
- paste into terminal

bug:
- shifting right/left on visual selection can lead to cursor getting set to -1, -1, not sure the exact case yet
- ctrl+q doesn't kill tab
- sometimes chain undo will undo 2 actions, not sure how to reproduce yet
