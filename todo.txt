todo:
- jump list
- multiple terminals
- add config option for log destination (Not sure if we want to do this, because we want to init the log before the user config)
- dired mode

bug:
- slow to start, wtf
- handle ctrl + c, we want to be able to send it to the terminal
- indentation sux in a lot of places right now
- divide by zero in ce_layout_distribute_rect()
